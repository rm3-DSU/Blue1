This project is to create a C2 system to explore malware concepts. There were issues with the fully implementing the client / server code, so the code included is nominal but is representative of some of the functionality that will be implemented once the client / server issues are resolved. 

Files included:

BarNapkin.txt: Quick overview of basic design requirements

clientFuncs.py: Nominal code representative of functions when implemented with functional client-server code

Slides_Matthews_BlueTeam_Cycle3.pdf: Slides of the presentation describing the project
